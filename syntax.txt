SL Syntax


Here is the explanation of each command:

print <message>: This command is used to display a message on the console. The message can be a string of text or a variable. To print a variable, use the syntax $<variable> instead of <message>.

input <message>: This command is used to take input from the user. The message is displayed to the user as a prompt. To store the input in a variable, use the syntax $<variable> instead of <message>.

set <variable> to <value>: This command is used to assign a value to a variable. The value can be a constant or the result of an operation between values or variables. If the value is a variable, use the syntax $<variable> instead of <value>.

get <variable>: This command is used to retrieve the value of a variable.

calc <value> <operator> <value>: This command is used to perform calculations. The values can be constants or variables. If the value is a variable, use the syntax $<variable> instead of <value>.

when <value> <operator> <value> then <command>: This command is used to execute a command only if a certain condition is met. The values can be constants or variables. If the value is a variable, use the syntax $<variable> instead of <value>. The <operator> can be any comparison operator such as "==" (equal to), "!=" (not equal to), ">" (greater than), ">=" (greater than or equal to), "<" (less than), or "<=" (less than or equal to).

exit: This command is used to exit the script.
