# SL-Simple-Language
Welcome to Simple Language(SL)!

This project is a simple programming language that aims to make it easy for beginners to get started with coding. The syntax is similar to MySQL, so if you have experience with that language, you should feel right at home with Simple Language.

The language is designed to be easy to read and understand, so you can focus on learning the fundamentals of programming without getting bogged down by complex syntax. We hope that Simple Language will be a helpful tool for anyone looking to learn programming or just wanting to build simple programs.

Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you have any suggestions for improvements or find any bugs. We are always looking for ways to make the language better. Thank you for checking out Simple Language!
